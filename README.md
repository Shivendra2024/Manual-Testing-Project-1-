Project Overview

GlobalSQA is a comprehensive platform offering resources for software testing and quality assurance (QA). This project focuses on performing manual testing on the GlobalSQA website, ensuring its quality across various aspects such as functionality, UI, performance, security, accessibility, and browser compatibility.

Objectives:

Identify and report defects to improve website quality.

Ensure the website meets functional and non-functional requirements.

Validate UI/UX consistency across different devices and browsers.

Test the security and accessibility features for compliance.

Scope of Testing:

The following types of manual testing will be performed:
